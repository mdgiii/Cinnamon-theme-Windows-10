# Cinnamon-theme-Windows-10

A custom Windows 10 theme for the Cinnamon enviornment/Linux Mint.

## Getting Started

*Install.sh coming soon*

1. Clone to local machine: `git clone https://github.com/mdgiii/Cinnamon-theme-Windows-10.git`.

2. (Optional) Open the "Themes" configuration tool, if you haven't before, to create the `/.themes` and `/.icons` folders.

2. Copy the contents of the wallpapers folder to the `/Pictures` folder in your home folder.

3. Right-click on your favorite wallpaper and click "Set as Wallpaper".

4. Copy the icons folder to the `/.icons` folder in your home folder.

## Customization

If you don't like the orange color on the Cinnamon menu, I've got good news. You can change the color!

1. Open `/Win10-theme/cinnamon/cinnamon.css` with your favorite text editor.

2. Open the find and replace dialog

3. The color that you are looking to replace is `#ff7500`.

4. Save file and restart Cinnamon.

## Disclaimer

None of the files found here are mine. I just pieced together different themes into one to create one theme that I enjoy.
